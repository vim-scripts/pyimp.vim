Set of functions to open a Python import statement as a file.
This is a modification of javaimp.vim by Darren Greaves <darren@krapplets.org> http://boncey.org/vim.shtml
Suggested stuff to add to your ~.vimrc:
let $PYTHONSOURCEPATH="/usr/lib/python2.2/,/usr/lib/python2.2/lib,/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages,~/python"
map H :call OpenPythonImport($PYTHONSOURCEPATH)<CR>
Then press H while on a import line and the file should open (you'll need the
source files and the path to have been set already.

The paths in $PYTHONSOURCEPATH should have the source packages directly
underneath each path.  The script needs to be able to add the package to the
path element and open a file.

I still need to figure out how to load the "from blah.bleh.blih import yada" type of imports
